# RSVP-Movies-Analysis-Using-SQL
Exploratory Data Analysis of RSVP Movies 
RSVP Movies, a leading Indian film production company, plans to release a global movie in 2022 and has tasked you with analyzing a dataset of movies from the past three years. Your role as a data analyst and SQL expert involves analyzing this data in four segments to provide actionable insights for their new project.
